    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For my final project, I would like to build a model that can **predict where patients will seek care for different health issues.** In every health system, there are a variety of health providers that people can visit to address health issues that arise. Global surveys of health behavior have found that many factors influence patient health seeking behavior, including distance from their home, cost of the provider, attitudes towards the government, and education levels. Patient care seeking patterns are one indicator of patient prefererences for health care in their country and could inform public health officials on which types of health providers they ought to use to meet patients where they prefer to receive healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many countries data does not exist on where patients seek care for health services, leaving public health officials to choose the location of service delivery based primarily on where it is easiest to deliver the services, rather than where it is preferrable to deliver the services from a patient's perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "*How Model Can Inform Decision Making*\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), I want to build a model that can predict patient care seeking patterns, leveraging commonly available demographic data as the primary features informing those predictions. Using this model, public health officials could make better decisions about where it is best to delivery public health interventions based on patient care seeking preferences. This model would be especially useful for settings that don't have data on patient care seeking, but do collect data on commonly available deomgrpahic information. "

    "## Data Source ##\n",
    "The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are surveys implemented nationally in many countries around the world. They provide information on key demographic and health behavior indicators. Countries often conduct a DHS every five years to allow for analysis over time and tracking of their progression against key population health indicators (e.g. immunization coverage or access to contraception). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will leverage the most recent surveys from 5-10 countries across the world. Different survey instruments are used for different groups of the population. The broadest and most comprehensive survey is the individual recode survey, which is given to women ages 15-49. The surveys are powered to the stratum level (every urban/rural x region combination), allowing for potential subnational variation to inform predictions. I will only use the individual recode survey for my model. "

    "The DHS provides many demogrpahic variables for each individual respondent to the survey. I will use several of the most commonly included features so that I can make a model that could be leveraged in many different settings even if the data is limited. There is likely to be collinearity between many of these features, which I will need to test for an consider when building out the model. Initially, the features I would like include are: \n",
